 * Defines the asynchronous transport layer for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
 *
 * <p>
 * The McpTransport interface provides the foundation for implementing custom transport
 * mechanisms in the Model Context Protocol. It handles the bidirectional communication
 * between the client and server components, supporting asynchronous message exchange
 * using JSON-RPC format.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Managing the lifecycle of the transport connection</li>
 * <li>Handling incoming messages and errors from the server</li>
 * <li>Sending outbound messages to the server</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The transport layer is designed to be protocol-agnostic, allowing for various
 * implementations such as WebSocket, HTTP, or custom protocols.
 * </p>
