/**
 * The core building block providing the server-side MCP transport. Implement this
 * interface to bridge between a particular server-side technology and the MCP server
 * transport layer.
 *
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of the provider dictates that it be created first, upon application
 * startup, and then passed into either
 * {@link io.modelcontextprotocol.server.McpServer#sync(McpServerTransportProvider)} or
 * {@link io.modelcontextprotocol.server.McpServer#async(McpServerTransportProvider)}. As
 * a result of the MCP server creation, the provider will be notified of a
 * {@link McpServerSession.Factory} which will be used to handle a 1:1 communication
 * between a newly connected client and the server. The provider's responsibility is to
 * create instances of {@link McpServerTransport} that the session will utilise during the
 * session lifetime.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally, the {@link McpServerTransport}s can be closed in bulk when {@link #close()} or
 * {@link #closeGracefully()} are called as part of the normal application shutdown event.
 * Individual {@link McpServerTransport}s can also be closed on a per-session basis, where
 * the {@link McpServerSession#close()} or {@link McpServerSession#closeGracefully()}
 * closes the provided transport.
