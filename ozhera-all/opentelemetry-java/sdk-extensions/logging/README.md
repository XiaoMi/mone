# OpenTelemetry Experimental Logging Support

This project contains experimental support for transport of logs via OpenTelemetry. The API
presented is intended for the use of logging library adapters to enable resource and request
correlation with other observability signals and transport of logs through the OpenTelemetry
collector.
