Tesla API Application Gateway is an application layer load balancer developed at Xiaomi Youpin that manages traffic requests from front-end devices (iOS, Android, web) to web services. Besides load balancing, it offers a variety of features, but most importantly, Tesla is performant and resistant to failure.

Features

Rate Limiting: Tesla sets limits on the number of concurrent requests, QPS, and timeout value.

Dynamic Routing Management and Load Balancing: Without modifying Ngxin config, Tesla allows routing configuration to be instantly changed dynamically.

Simple start and shutdown of API: Starting or shutting down an API requires only one button click.

Token Authentication and Security: Tokens are used to authenticate API requests.

Mock Interface: Tesla accepts mock data, which is useful for testing APIs.

Result Caching: API responses are stored in a cache.

Cross-Domain Request: Tesla supports allowing cross-domain access.

Aggregation of Multiple APIs: Instead of having service providers to write a new API, Tesla supports combining multiple APIs to create a new API.

Protocol Decoupling: At Xiaomi Youpin, back-end services employ a range of communication protocols (Apache Dubbo, HTTP, rpcx, etc â€¦). Tesla accepts an HTTP request from a client, and then forwards it to a back-end service that may uses a different protocol, for example, Apache Dubbo.

A/B Testing: Based on a list of configured parameters including API version and IP address, Tesla routes traffic to different versions of the same back-end service.

Third Party Filters: Tesla contains a framework that dynamically compiles and runs filters developed by third parties. These filters provide custom features. Currently, Tesla supports filters written in Java.
