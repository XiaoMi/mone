/**
 * ValueRecorder is a synchronous instrument useful for recording any number, positive or negative.
 * Values captured by a Record(value) are treated as individual events belonging to a distribution
 * that is being summarized.
 *
 * <p>ValueRecorder should be chosen either when capturing measurements that do not contribute
 * meaningfully to a sum, or when capturing numbers that are additive in nature, but where the
 * distribution of individual increments is considered interesting.
 *
 * <p>One of the most common uses for ValueRecorder is to capture latency measurements. Latency
 * measurements are not additive in the sense that there is little need to know the latency-sum of
 * all processed requests. We use a ValueRecorder instrument to capture latency measurements
 * typically because we are interested in knowing mean, median, and other summary statistics about
 * individual events.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class YourClass {
 *
 *   private static final Meter meter = OpenTelemetry.getMeterProvider().get("my_library_name");
 *   private static final DoubleValueRecorder valueRecorder =
 *       meter.
 *           .doubleValueRecorderBuilder("doWork_latency")
 *           .setDescription("gRPC Latency")
 *           .setUnit("ms")
 *           .build();
 *
 *   // It is recommended that the API user keep references to a Bound Counters.
 *   private static final BoundDoubleValueRecorder someWorkBound =
 *       valueRecorder.bind("work_name", "some_work");
 *
 *   void doWork() {
 *      long startTime = System.nanoTime();
 *      // Your code here.
 *      someWorkBound.record((System.nanoTime() - startTime) / 1e6);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
